# What is this?

This is simple pomodoro desktop app written using tauri and svelte. It allows you to play and pause your pomodoro, as well as set custom times for your pomodoro and break periods. To run the app you should be able to do a simple:

```
npm install
npm run tauri dev
```

or you can install one of the release builds. This is my first attempt using tauri, and nothing is actually coded in rust, but I plan to change that in the future.
